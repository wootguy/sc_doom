# Doom 2 for Sven Co-op
Sven Co-op scripts for the [doom2 maps](http://scmapdb.com/map:doom-ii).


# Installation

Steps here are slightly different than on SCMapDB because the plugin is moved and renamed.

1. Click "Clone or download" then "Download Zip"
2. Extract the files inside "sc_doom-master" into your "svencoop_downloads/scripts/maps/doom/" folder
3. Add this to default_plugins.txt:
  ```
	"plugin"
	{
		"name" "doom_maps"
		"script" "../maps/doom/doom_plugin"
	}
  ```
